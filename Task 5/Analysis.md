# Regression Algorithms

1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree Regression
3. Support Vector Regression
4. Ridge Regression
5. Lasso Regression

 In this task we have been given with the **Titanic** DataSet and been asked to train the machine learning model using these algorithms. And the data preprocessing has been done with 70% and 30% split of dataset for training and testing.
 
## Accuracy of all the models
 
  1. Logistic Regression  -  85.7%
  2. Decision Tree Regression  -  83.8%
  3. Support Vector Regression  -  81.1%
  4. Ridge Regression  -  86.4%
  5. Lasso Regression  -  86.5%

## Conclusion

  This is problem should be more or less solved by a classification algorithm, even though it can be solved by regression algorithms too. So ***Logistic Regression*** would be much more preferable algorithm even if its accuracy is comparitively less (85.7%). Here in this case we use regression to find out the probability value of a passenger's survival.
